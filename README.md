# back-to-basics


Here I will try to implement some basic algorithms and data structures.
I am thinking to follow the order from here: http://tinyurl.com/m2mgwj9 .

I will try to implement all the code both in python and c++.
It would be nice if I could also other languages, but let's start first :) .

Foreach algorithm I will use use an example to see an example of usage
and measure it's perfomance.

The implementations will not be generic, but they should solve the
specified problem.


In most of the programming languages the algorithms are already builtin in
the languages. When we write actual code makes sense to use the official
implementations or ones from well known external packages. I will try to
add references to the language implementations of the algorithm where possible.

Each of the specified problem maybe has a better
solution (i.e. by using another data structure). If I can think an alternative
solution (maybe better/worse) I will mention my idea in the readme.md.

The goal is to learn how/when to use the algorithm or data structure and
learn how it works in a real example.

### Project Format

- family/"algo or data-structure"/
    - /c++
    - /python
    - /other-lang
    - readme.md
    - other-file.txt

One folder per algorithm/data-structure/family of algs, which should contain
a readme.md file and folders with the implementations in the different
languages.

The readme.md file should specify an example of a problem that the algorithm
coulb be usefull.
Also it may contains references for studying the algorithms and alternative
solutions.

The directory also can contain some other files that are common to all
implementaions (usually to create demo data).
