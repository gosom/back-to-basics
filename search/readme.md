# Search

Let's assume we have some files that represent telephone catalogs.
We want to be able to locate if a name exists on the catalog.

File build-demo-data.py will be used to generate telephone catalogs of
different sizes.

The catalogs are in the folder data and named catalog1.txt, ..., catalog10.txt.
